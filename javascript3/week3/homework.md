# Homework

## So why should i do this homework

Using classes help with structuring code. It is one of many **design patterns**.  Second it **connects everything** you have learned in js: functions, properties, methods, keys, arrays.

If you struggle to do this weeks homework there are a couple of things to do:

- Try watch this: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-HGdc8L-7w&t=565s>
- Watch the class recording. If it for some reason is missing. Then watch these: [part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfEeUcT0PWY), [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbnKWe92uv4), [part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lqbVK12lWM) [part 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Stsveg4rg)

## Lets make some art using classes

Lets create lots of circles in different sizes and colors on a webpage!

In HTML5 there is an elements called canvas. It **works just like a real canvas.** You can paint elements like lines, circles and much more to the canvas.

### Paint a circle to a canvas element

First add the `canvas` element to your html. Now draw a circle on the `canvas` using js. Google is your friend here :)

When you have added a normal circle, try filling it out so it has a color. Again google time!

### Class creation time

Lets create a class called `Circle`. The circle should be used like this:

```js
const c1 = new Circle(50, 50, 20, 0, 2 * Math.PI, '#000000');
c1.draw();
```

Where the constructor should look like this: `constructor(x, y, r, startAngle, endAngle, fillColor)`

The circle should have one method: `draw` that **draws the circle to the canvas**. That means that creating an instance of the circle class will not draw the circle. **Drawing the circle** first happens when we **call the draw method.**

Test if the new class works by creating a circle and drawing it to the canvas. Try some different radiuses, positions and fill colors.

### Now lets make art

Every 100ms create a new circle class and draw that to the canvas.

The circle should have random `x`, `y`, `radius` and `color`. For giving the `circle` a random color what should we do?? We should google off course!

What if we wanted the canvas to have the same width and height of the screen?

### Follow the mouse - optional

Instead of the circles just randomly appearing on the screen, make them appear around the cursor.

## Getting into promises

Lets use the github api to see **what repositories different users have**. You can use this url to get repositories for a specific github username, in this case the username `benna100`: `https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=user:benna100`. Select 3 classmates github username that you want to show repositories for.

Fetch all the 3 classmates repositories **at the same time using Promise.all.** Remember the **all at once** exercise [here?](../week2/homework.md#visual-promise)

When you have the data for the different repositories, **render the fullname** of the repo, **url** of the repo, and **the owner** of the repo. See [github-repos](homework/github-repos.html) as an example of how the renderered repos should look. You are more than welcome to style it a bit nicer!

## Shopping cart using Classes

Let's get a bit more into creating classes!

```js

class Product {
    constructor(name, price) {
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price;
    }
}

class ShoppingCart {
    constructor() {
        this.products = [];
    }

    addProduct(product) {
        // Implement functionality here
    }

    removeProduct(product) {
        // Implement functionality here
    }

    searchProduct(productName) {
        // Implement functionality here
    }

    getTotal() {
        // Implement functionality here
    }

    renderProducts() {
        // Implement functionality here
    }

    getUser() {
        // Implement functionality here
    }
}

const shoppingCart = new ShoppingCart();
const flatscreen = new Product('flat-screen', 5000);
shoppingCart.addProduct(flatscreen);

```

So we have two classes. `Product` represents products. `ShoppingCart` represents a shopping cart.

### Part 1

Create the functionality for the `ShoppingCart` class.

- `addProduct` should add a product to the products array.
- `removeProduct` should remove a product from the products array.
- `getTotal` should get the total price of the products in the `shoppingcart`.
- `renderProducts` should render the products to html. You decide what to show and how.
- `searchProduct` should return an array of product that match the `productName` parameter
- `getUser` should return a promise with the data from this api: <https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1>

### Part 2

Try and create some products and call the `addProduct` and the `removeProduct` functions to see if they work.

Call the `getUser` function to get a user. When the user has been fetched. Render the products using the `renderProducts` method. Also render the username and the total price of the products in the `shoppingcart`.

*Optional and a little tricky!* Create a **searchbar where a user can search for a product.** Matching product are shown as an autocomplete. **Clicking a product** in the autocomplete **opens a modal** with product information.

### Part 3

The `Product` class should get a method called `convertToCurrency`. The function should have `currency` as a parameter. Depending on the **provided currency return the correct price** for the product. Add 3 or more curriencies. Or use an api for getting the price dependent on a currency that `convertToCurrency` uses.

```js
// Assuming dkr as default currency
const plant = new Product('plant', 50);
console.log(plant.convertToCurrency('dollars')) // 7.5
```

### Part 4, optional

Be creative! Create some cool/weird/quirky functionality of either the `Product` class or the `ShoppingCart` class.

## Feedback giving time

Find a student to give feedback using this site: <https://hyf-peer-review.herokuapp.com/>
The feedback should be given after the homework has been handed in preferably latest two days after.

To help you get started we have created some ressources about giving feedback. Find them here: <https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/curriculum/tree/master/review>

## Hand in Homework

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feyBVDhFQuk) for a more detailed go-through of how to hand in homework!

- Create a new branch called `javascript/javascript3/week3`
- Add all your changes to this branch in the `javascript/javascript3/week3` folder.
- Go through the [Homework checklist](#homework-checklist)
- Create a pull request using the `javascript/javascript3/week3` branch
- Wait for mentor feedback
- Implement feedback, `add`, `commit` and `push` the changes
- Now you can merge the changes into `master`
- When merged you can **share the github link** to your classes slack channel if you are **proud of what you did** ðŸ’ª
- Now celebrate ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## Homework checklist

Go over your homework one last time:

- [ ] Does every file run without errors and with the correct results?
- [ ] Have you used `const` and `let` and avoided `var`?
- [ ] Do the variable, function and argument names you created follow the [Naming Conventions](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/naming_conventions.md)?
- [ ] Is your code well-formatted (see [Code Formatting](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/naming_conventions.md))?
